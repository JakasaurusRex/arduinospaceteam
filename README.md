### 🚀 Overview  🚀
This project is a modification of a space game, originally created by Mark Santolucito for Barnard COMS 3930. 
The Original Game is based on Spacetime, which is an interactive multiplayer game in which the team has to complete task collectives. 
Each player has an instruction and a set of actions that they can do. Players have to read their instructions out loud so the other players can execute the right actions. 


### 🔧 Hardware  🔧 
This code was written and tested in esp 32 (Lilly TTGO).

- Added a unique color for each user based on macadress
- Added a clock.
